        <p>Hi! My name is Hoa Le, and I go by Harvey.</p>

        <p>On the first day of 2024, I registered for the FRM Part 1 exam, embarking on a new career journey in 
          Financial Risk Management 
          with a focus on Credit Risk. I passed the exam in May 2024 with only 10 days of self-study 
          thanks to having a strategy tailored to my educational background, learning style, and schedule.
        </p>

        <p>This website presents some projects I have worked on 
         in the domains of credit risk and data science. Check them out! ðŸ‘‡
