        <h1>Hoa Le - Credit Risk Analyst</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my personal portfolio website!</p>
        <p>I am a financial consultant in Boston, Massachusetts. 
            On the first day of 2024, I decided to embark on a new career journey - Risk Management. 
            This website is to highlight some projects that I have worked on that require knowledge 
            in the domain of credit risk and in data science.</p>
        <p>Check them out below! ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡</p>

    <p>The website looks pretty simple and even ugly right now. That's because I am learning HTML and CSS  
      during my free evening time, and wanted to apply the new skills to build my website from 
      scratch instead of using templates. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I'm excited to show more beautiful features and designs in no time!</p>
