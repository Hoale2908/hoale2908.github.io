Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

My name is Hoa Le. I am currently working as a financial consultant in Boston, MA. 

I recently embarked on a new career journey - Risk Management - which I find very interesting and intellectural stimulating. Fortunately, I'm also a Python enthusiast and there are so many areas in Risk Management for me to put my Python skills into practice.

Check out some of my personal projects below!

-------

## ðŸ’° CREDIT RISK
- [Predicting Corporate Default (Python)](https://github.com/Hoale2908/Predicting-Company-Default/blob/main/README.md)
- [Predicting Retail Mortgage Default (Python)](https://github.com/Hoale2908/retail_mortgage/blob/a4f35e5efdadcb9ecf4a7e41cda5a45583035766/Retail%20Mortgage%20Portfolio%20Model.ipynb)
- Stress Testing (in progress)
- Monte Carlo simulation (in progress)

## ðŸ”‹ PRODUCTIVITY BOOST 
In addition to finance and risk, I am passionate about process improvement. I enjoy learning Python in my free time, and applying it to solve real life problems. 

Some projects that saved me (and my colleagues) from mundane tasks or expensive proprietary tools:
