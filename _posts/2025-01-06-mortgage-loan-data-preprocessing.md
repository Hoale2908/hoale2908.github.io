Data wrangling is often the unsung hero in any data analysis project. In this project, I took a messy, raw mortgage loans dataset and transformed it into a clean, structured, and insightful resource for further analysis. Let me walk you through the steps I took and the challenges I overcame along the way.

## Understanding the Raw Data

The journey began with an in-depth exploration of the raw dataset. The dataset contained several issues:

- Inconsistent formats: Date fields and numerical values were not standardized.
- Missing and incomplete Data: Many records had missing entries, which could lead to biased analyses if not properly addressed.
- Redundant information: Some columns contained duplicate or irrelevant data.

By closely examining the dataset, I was able to identify these issues early on, setting the stage for a robust data wrangling process.

### Step 1: Data Cleaning

**Handling Missing Values**

One of the first tasks was to address missing values. I employed strategies such as:

- Imputation: Where logical, I imputed missing values using statistical measures (e.g., mean or median) from the surrounding data.
- Removal: In cases where imputation was not feasible or would compromise data integrity, I removed the problematic records.

**Removing Duplicates**

Duplicate entries can skew any analysis. I carefully checked for duplicates and removed them to ensure the dataset was as accurate as possible.

**Standardizing Data Formats**

Data coming from different sources often have varying formats. I:
- Unified date formats to a standard format.
- Converted numerical fields to appropriate data types, ensuring consistency across the board.

These cleaning steps ensured that every record in the dataset was usable and reliable.

### Step 2: Data Transformation

Once the dataset was clean, I focused on transforming the data into a format that could be easily analyzed.

**Standardization of Variables**

Inconsistent categorical variables were encoded uniformly. This step was crucial for any downstream analysis, ensuring that each category was correctly interpreted by the analytical models.

**Creating New Features**

To enhance the dataset, I engineered new features that could provide additional insights. For example:
- Loan-to-Value Ratio: I derived this metric to assess the risk associated with each mortgage loan. This new feature provided a more nuanced view of each loan’s characteristics.

### Step 3: Visualizing the Transformation

Visualizations played a key role in understanding the impact of the data wrangling process. Here are two charts generated directly from the notebook that highlight the transformation:

### Before Data Wrangling

In the “before” chart, you can see the raw state of the dataset. Notice the inconsistencies, missing values, and scattered data points that make it difficult to draw any reliable conclusions.

### After Data Wrangling

After applying the cleaning and transformation steps, the dataset looks much more organized. The “after” chart demonstrates:
- Consistent data formatting,
- Cleaned and imputed values,
- Enhanced features ready for analysis.

These visual comparisons clearly showcase the improvement in data quality, making it a perfect foundation for deeper analysis.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates that effective data wrangling is more than just a preliminary step—it’s a transformative process that can turn a messy dataset into a reliable and insightful resource. By meticulously cleaning, transforming, and enriching the mortgage loans dataset, I ensured that subsequent analyses would be both meaningful and accurate.
