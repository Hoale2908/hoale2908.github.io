        <p>Hi! My name is Hoa Le, and I go by Harvey.</p>

        <p>On the first day of 2024, I decided to embark on a new career journey in Financial Risk Management 
          with a focus on Credit Risk by registering for the FRM Part 1 exam. I passed the exam in May 2024 with only 10 days of self-study 
          thanks to having a strategy tailored to my educational background, learning style, and schedule.

        <p>This website presents some of my projects  
         in the domains of credit risk and data science. Check them out! ðŸ‘‡
