        <p>Welcome to my portfolio website! My name is Hoa Le, and I go by Harvey.</p>

        <p>On the first day of 2024, I registered for the FRM Part 1 exam, embarking on a new career journey in 
          Financial Risk Management 
          with a focus on Credit Risk. I passed the exam in May 2024 with only 10 days of self-study 
          thanks to having a strategy tailored to my educational background, learning style, and schedule.
        </p>

        <p>This website presents some projects I have worked on 
         in the domains of credit risk and data science. Check them out! ðŸ‘‡

          <p>This project aims at predicting whether a company will default on its debt based on its public financial information.</p>
          <p>Models are developed with Logistic Regression and Gradient Boosting.</p>

          <h3>Mortgage Loan Default - Data Preprocessing Using Machine Learning Techniques</h3>
          <hr>

          <p> Data preprocessing is crucial in developing a default prediction model, as it ensures the accuracy and 
            reliability of the model by handling missing values, outliers, and noisy data, allowing for better feature 
            extraction and improved predictive performance.</p>
          <p>This dataset contains nearly 150,000 mortgage loan applications in 2019 with 32 attributes. Using 
            statistical analysis and data visualization, I analyzed the data to detect 
            outliers and missing values, as well as implemented appropriate methods of data transformation to ensure data quality 
            for modeling purposes.</p>
