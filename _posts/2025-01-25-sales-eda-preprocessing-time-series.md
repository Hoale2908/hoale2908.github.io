# Forecasting Sticker Sales - EDA & Preprocessing with Time Series

## Introduction

Accurate sales forecasting is crucial for businesses to optimize inventory, reduce waste, and maximize profitability. My recent Kaggle notebook, [Forecasting Sticker Sales: EDA & Preprocessing](https://www.kaggle.com/code/hoale2908/forecasting-sticker-sales-eda-preprocessing), demonstrates my expertise in exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data preprocessing—critical steps in building reliable predictive models. This blog highlights key aspects of my approach, showcasing my ability to analyze trends, handle missing data, and prepare datasets for forecasting.

## Executive Summary

This project focuses on analyzing and preparing a dataset of sticker sales for predictive modeling. The key takeaways include:

- **Comprehensive EDA**: Identified sales trends, seasonality, and potential anomalies through visualizations and statistical analysis.
- **Data Cleaning & Imputation**: Addressed missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to improve data quality.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracted meaningful features such as sales trends, promotional effects, and seasonality factors.
- **Scalability Considerations**: Ensured data preprocessing techniques were adaptable to larger datasets for real-world applications.

By structuring the analysis in a clear, logical manner, I provided a strong foundation for effective forecasting models.

## Key Highlights of the Analysis

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA is the backbone of any data-driven project. In this notebook, I employed:
- **Time-Series Visualization**: Using line plots and histograms to examine sales patterns.
- **Trend & Seasonality Detection**: Applying rolling averages and decomposition techniques to separate long-term trends from cyclical variations.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying anomalies that could distort forecasting models.

These insights guided the feature selection and data cleaning process, ensuring that models would be trained on high-quality data.

### 2. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Raw datasets often contain inconsistencies that must be addressed before model training. My approach included:
- **Handling Missing Values**: Imputing gaps in sales data using forward-fill methods and median-based techniques.
- **Dealing with Outliers**: Implementing robust statistical methods to smooth unexpected spikes or drops in sales.
- **Standardization & Normalization**: Ensuring data was appropriately scaled for machine learning models.

This preprocessing step enhanced the dataset’s reliability and predictive power.

### 3. Feature Engineering for Forecasting
Feature engineering plays a crucial role in improving model performance. Key steps included:
- **Date-Based Features**: Extracting day-of-week, month, and holiday effects to capture periodic sales fluctuations.
- **Lag Variables**: Creating lagged sales features to help models recognize past sales dependencies.
- **Rolling Statistics**: Incorporating moving averages to capture recent sales trends.

By transforming raw data into insightful features, I provided a structured input for forecasting models.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my ability to conduct in-depth data analysis and prepare datasets for predictive modeling. By leveraging advanced EDA techniques, rigorous data cleaning, and strategic feature engineering, I laid the groundwork for building robust forecasting models.
