Forecast Sticker Sales is a playground competition hosted by Kaggle. For this challenge, users will be predicting multiple years worth of sales for various Kaggle-branded stickers from different fictitious stores in different (real) countries. 

The train set contains data of 5 products sold at 3 different stores over 6 countries from 2010 to 2016. The test set contains the same information, omitting sales, from 2017 to 2019.

In this project, I preprocessed the data ([Forecasting Sticker Sales (Part 1) - EDA & Preprocessing with Time Series](https://hoale2908.github.io/featured/2025/01/25/sales-eda-preprocessing-time-series.html)) and used it for prediction using a Decision Tree model.
