# A Snow Day in Boston... and a Python project

Yep, you read it right. It was snowing here in Boston in a long holiday weekend (Martin Luther King's day), as it usually did every winter. But yesterday there was a snowstorm coming and the Weather app on iPhone (or the national weather office) predicted that it would start at 1 PM. I delayed my plan to go to the Boston Public Library and other plans because I didn't want to be trapped outside, or on the T during such condition. As I stayed at home, I wondered if it has been snowing more or less over the recent years? How often does Boston have snow or snow storms? And there I went to find the answers, which led me to a small yet interesting project.
