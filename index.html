    <h1>Hoa Le - Credit Risk Analyst</h1>
      <p>
          <br>Welcome to my personal portfolio website!
          <br>
          <br>My name is Hoa Le and I am currently working as a financial consultant in Boston, Massachusetts. 
          On the first day of 2024, I decided to embark on a new career journey - Risk Management, an area I find 
          so interesting and intellectual stimulating. This website is to introduce some projects 
          that I have worked on that require knowledge in the domain of credit risk and in data science.
          <br>
          <br> Check them out below! ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

    <p>As you can see, the website looks pretty simple and even ugly right now. That's because I am learning HTML (and CSS next) 
      during my evening time after my full-time job and FRM Part 2 exam prep, and wanted to apply the new skills to build it from the 
      ground up instead of using templates. Excited to show you a more beautiful website in no time.</p>
