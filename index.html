    <h1>Hoa Le - Credit Risk Analyst</h1>
      <p>
        <br>Welcome to my personal portfolio website!
        <br>
        <br>My name is Hoa Le and I am currently working as a financial consultant in Boston, Massachusetts. 
          On the first day of 2024, I decided to embark on a new career journey - Risk Management, an area I find 
          so interesting and intellectual stimulating. This website is to introduce some projects 
          that I have worked on that require knowledge in the domain of credit risk and in data science.
        <br>
        <br> Check them out below! ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡

    <p>As you can see, the website looks pretty simple and even ugly right now. That's because I am learning HTML (and CSS next) 
      during my free evening time, and wanted to apply the new skills to build my website from 
      scratch instead of using templates. Excited to show you a more beautiful features and design in no time!</p>
