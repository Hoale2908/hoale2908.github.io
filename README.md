Hello! 👋 

My name is Hoa Le. I am currently working as a financial consultant in Boston, MA. 

I recently embarked on a new career journey - Risk Management, an area I find very interesting and intellectual stimulating. Fortunately, I'm also a Python enthusiast and there are so many areas in Risk Management for me to put my Python skills into practice.

Check out some of my personal projects below!
