Hello! ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a financial consultant with a background in finance and accounting. I'm also a Python enthusiast. I recently embarked on a new journey which I find very interesting and intellectural simulating - Risk Management. 

Check out some of my personal projects below!

-------

## ðŸ’° CREDIT RISK
- [Predicting Corporate Default (Python)](https://github.com/Hoale2908/Predicting-Company-Default/blob/main/README.md)
- [Predicting Retail Mortgage Default (Python)](https://github.com/Hoale2908/retail_mortgage/blob/a4f35e5efdadcb9ecf4a7e41cda5a45583035766/Retail%20Mortgage%20Portfolio%20Model.ipynb)

## ðŸ”‹ PRODUCTIVITY BOOST 
In addition to finance and risk, I am passionate about process improvement. I enjoy learning Python in my free time, and applying it to solve real life problems. 

Some projects that save me (and my colleagues) from mundane tasks or expensive proprietary tools:
