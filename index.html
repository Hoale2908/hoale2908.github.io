        <h1>Credit Risk Project Portfolio</h1>
        
        <p>Greetings from Boston, Massachusetts! My name is Hoa Le, and I go by Harvey.</p>

        <p>On the first day of 2024, I decided to embark on a new career journey - Risk Management. 
        This website highlights some projects that I have worked on that require knowledge 
        in the domains of credit risk and data science.</p>

        <p>Check them out! ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡</p>

    <p>The website looks pretty simple and even ugly right now. That's because I am learning HTML and CSS  
      during my free evening time, and wanted to apply the new skills to build my website from 
      scratch instead of using templates. Thank you for your patience and understanding. I'm excited to show more beautiful features and designs in no time!</p>
