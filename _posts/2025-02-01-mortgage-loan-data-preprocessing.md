This project focuses on preprocessing a dataset of 150,000 mortgage loan applications from 2019. The goal is to clean the data, handle missing values, and detect outliers to prepare it for predictive modeling and analysis.

## Features  
- **Data Cleaning:** Removed noisy and irrelevant data to enhance dataset quality.  
- **Handling Missing Values:** Applied imputation techniques to address incomplete records.  
- **Outlier Detection:** Identified and treated outliers to ensure accurate modeling.  
- **Visualization:** Leveraged Matplotlib and Seaborn for data exploration and insights.  

## Libraries Used  
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.  
- **NumPy:** For numerical computations.  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn:** For data visualization.  

## Dataset  
The dataset contains information on mortgage loan applications from 2019. It includes 32 features and can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/loan-default-dataset).

## Future Enhancements  
- Implement additional preprocessing techniques for more complex datasets.  
- Integrate machine learning models for predictive analysis.
